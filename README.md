### Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is the course project for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course.
The R script `runAnalysis.R` does the following:

1. Loads the training and test datasets and the subject data for each of them and merges them all
2. Extracts the columns which contain a mean or standard deviation
3. Labels the data set with descriptive variable names
4. Replaces the activity values by descriptive names
5. Creates a tidy dataset that contains the average (mean) value of each
   variable for each subject and activity pair.

The end result is shown in the file `tidy_data.txt`.
